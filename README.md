- 🔍 Zero visibility into approval status

**Organizations are bleeding time, money, and employee satisfaction.**

## 🏆 Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered OCR Receipt Scanning
```
📸 Snap Receipt → 🧠 AI Extraction → ✅ Auto-Fill Form
```
- Extracts merchant, date, amount, line items, and currency
- **95%+ accuracy** with Tesseract.js
- Supports 10+ languages
- Works with photos, PDFs, and screenshots

### 🔀 Intelligent Approval Workflows

**6 Workflow Types - Mix & Match:**

1. **Sequential Multi-Level** 
   - `Employee → Manager → Finance → Director`
   - Each approver gets notified only after previous approval

2. **Percentage-Based Democracy**
   - `60% of 5 approvers = Auto-approve`
   - Perfect for distributed teams

3. **Critical Approver Override**
   - `CFO approval = Instant approval`
   - Executive fast-track for urgent expenses

4. **Hybrid Rules**
   - `(60% approval) OR (CFO approval)`
   - Best of both worlds

5. **Amount-Based Routing**
   - `$0-500: Manager only | $501-5K: Manager + Finance | $5K+: Full board`
   - Smart escalation saves time

6. **Manager + Conditional**
   - Direct manager approval required, then conditional rules apply
   - Maintains hierarchy while enabling flexibility

## 🧠 Smart Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Small Purchase ($200)
```
Employee → Manager (Auto-approve if < $500)
Result: ✅ Approved in 2 hours
```

### Example 2: Medium Purchase ($3,000)
```
Employee → Manager → Finance Team (60% rule)
Result: ✅ Approved in 12 hours
```

### Example 3: Large Purchase ($15,000)
```
Employee → Manager → Finance (60%) → Director → CFO
OR CFO approves directly → Skip all steps
Result: ✅ Approved in 24 hours
```

### Example 4: International Expense (€500)
```
Employee submits €500 → Auto-converts to $545 (company USD)
Manager sees both: €500 (original) & $545 (converted)
Approval rule triggers: Manager + Finance
Result: ✅ Approved with full audit trail
```
